# Book Solution Pack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book)

## Introduction

Allows for the creation of book and page objects (islandora:bookCModel,islandora:pageCModel). Books are essentially a collection of pages, containing only metadata and optionally a PDF file of the book. A book's PDF can be generated from each page. Pages are based on an uploaded tiff of the page. From the uploaded TIFF its possible to generate images for use in the "Islandora Internet Archive Bookreader". It is also possible to generate PDF files per page. OCR and OCR coordinate data can also be generated from the uploaded TIFF.

### Known issues

* **Islandora Book MODS Form**: In August 2018, a bug in the Book MODS form was identified and fixed. 
The form's **ISBN** element was set to READ all instances of any MODS identifier element, but to CREATE identifiers with the 'type="isbn"' attribute. 
When editing an object with this form, the form would create a new copy of every identifier element regardless of attributes, which may have led users to remove those identifiers. 
Any objects edited using this form before the August 2018 fix should be reviewed to ensure their metadata is correct.
