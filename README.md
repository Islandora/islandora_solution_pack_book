# Book Solution Pack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book)

## Introduction

Allows for the creation of book and page objects (islandora:bookCModel,islandora:pageCModel). Books are essentially a collection of pages, containing only metadata and optionally a PDF file of the book. A book's PDF can be generated from each page. Pages are based on an uploaded tiff of the page. From the uploaded TIFF its possible to generate images for use in the "Islandora Internet Archive Bookreader". It is also possible to generate PDF files per page. OCR and OCR coordinate data can also be generated from the uploaded TIFF.
